            by state-run public education system, which fall under the command of the 
            government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under various articles
            of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
            Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
            right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private
            schools in India is 7:5.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Early education in India commenced 
            under the supervision of a guru or prabhu.The education was delivered
             through Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and Shishya was very important
              part of the education.Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest 
              recorded centre of higher learning in India from possibly 8th century BCE, and it
               is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense, 
               since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular 
               colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls
                and residential quarters in a Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university 
                in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the
                 world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in 
                 Ariano -PÃ¡li language.
